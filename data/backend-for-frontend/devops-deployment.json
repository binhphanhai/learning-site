      "options": [
        "Horizontal adds more containers, vertical adds more resources to existing containers",
        "Vertical adds more containers, horizontal adds more resources",
        "They are the same thing",
        "Horizontal is for databases, vertical is for applications"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Horizontal scaling (scaling out) adds more container instances to handle load, while vertical scaling (scaling up) increases resources (CPU, memory) allocated to existing containers."
