# Frontend Engineer Learning Roadmap

## Junior Level

### 1. Core Frontend Skills
- **JavaScript/TypeScript basics**: variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, loops, conditionals, ES6 features (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring), basic TypeScript types (string, number, boolean, array, object, any), interfaces, type annotations.
- **React fundamentals**: components (function/class), props, state, event handling, JSX, component lifecycle, basic hooks (useState, useEffect), rendering lists, conditional rendering.
- **Building and styling components**: using CSS, Sass, or styled-components, applying classes and inline styles, Ant Design components, customizing styles, responsive layouts with flexbox and grid.
- **Using Ant Design or similar UI libraries**: installing and importing components, using layout/grid systems, customizing themes, leveraging prebuilt UI elements (buttons, forms, modals, tables).
- **Responsive design basics**: media queries, mobile-first design, viewport units, testing on different devices, using browser dev tools for responsiveness.

### 2. Backend & API Basics
- **Node.js and TypeScript basics**: understanding Node.js runtime, npm/yarn, writing simple scripts, using TypeScript in Node.js, basic Express.js usage.
- **RESTful API concepts and usage**: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, making API requests with fetch/Axios, handling JSON, understanding endpoints and parameters.
- **Basic authentication (OAuth2, JWT)**: what is authentication, how OAuth2 and JWT work, storing tokens, sending tokens in headers, basic security considerations.

### 3. Database Fundamentals
- **SQL basics**: tables, rows, columns, primary keys, writing simple SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries.
- **Simple query writing**: filtering with WHERE, sorting with ORDER BY, joining tables with JOIN, using LIMIT/OFFSET.

### 4. Version Control & CI/CD
- **Git basics**: initializing repos, cloning, staging, committing, pushing, pulling, branching, merging, resolving conflicts, using .gitignore.
- **Understanding CI/CD pipelines**: what is CI/CD, benefits, basic pipeline stages (install, test, build, deploy), using GitHub Actions/GitLab CI, reading pipeline logs.

### 5. Testing & Debugging
- **Basic troubleshooting and debugging**: using console.log, browser dev tools (Elements, Console, Network), reading error messages, fixing common bugs.
- **Writing simple unit tests**: what is a unit test, using Jest or React Testing Library, writing test cases for functions/components, running tests, interpreting results.

### 6. Code Quality & Documentation
- **Code reviews**: submitting PRs, reviewing others' code, giving/receiving feedback, following style guides.
- **Writing clear technical documentation**: README basics, documenting functions/components, using comments, keeping docs up to date.

### 7. Communication & Collaboration
- **Working with product/design teams**: understanding requirements, asking clarifying questions, using design tools (Figma, Zeplin), giving feedback.
- **Communicating with technical and non-technical members**: explaining technical concepts simply, writing clear messages, participating in meetings.
