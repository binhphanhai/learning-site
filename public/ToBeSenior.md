# To Be Senior Frontend Engineer

## 1. Advanced JavaScript & TypeScript
- **Deep understanding of ES6+ features**: let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest, template literals, default parameters, classes, modules, iterators, generators, async/await, etc.
- **TypeScript advanced types and generics**: interfaces, type aliases, enums, union/intersection types, mapped types, conditional types, utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.), generics in functions and classes, type inference, declaration merging, type guards, discriminated unions.
- **Asynchronous programming**: Promises, async/await, error handling, Promise.all/race, callback patterns, event loop, microtasks vs macrotasks.
- **Functional programming concepts**: pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, closures, currying, composition, map/filter/reduce, side effects, declarative vs imperative code.

## 2. React Ecosystem Mastery
- **React 19 advanced patterns**: hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, useRef, custom hooks), context API, suspense and concurrent features, error boundaries, portals, forward refs, render props, compound components, controlled vs uncontrolled components.
- **State management**: Redux Toolkit (slices, thunks, selectors, middleware), Zustand, React Query (data fetching, caching, mutations, query invalidation), context for global state, when to use which tool.
- **Performance optimization**: memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback), virtualization (react-window, react-virtualized), lazy loading, code splitting (React.lazy, Suspense), avoiding unnecessary re-renders, profiling with React DevTools.
- **Component design and reusability**: atomic design principles, prop drilling vs context, composition over inheritance, reusable UI patterns, accessibility in components, storybook for component development.
- **Custom hooks and context providers**: extracting logic into hooks, sharing state/context, best practices for context performance, testing custom hooks.

## 3. Next.js & SSR/SSG
- **Next.js routing and layouts**: file-based routing, dynamic routes, nested layouts, middleware, route groups, parallel routes.
- **Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)**: getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, getStaticPaths, ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), when to use SSR vs SSG vs CSR.
- **API routes and middleware**: building API endpoints in Next.js, middleware for authentication, logging, rate limiting, edge functions.
- **Incremental static regeneration (ISR)**: updating static content after deployment, revalidation strategies.
- **Next.js 15 new features**: app directory, server components, streaming, enhanced routing, etc.

## 4. UI/UX & Design Systems
- **Ant Design customization and theming**: overriding default styles, using theme variables, custom components, integrating with Sass/LESS.
- **Responsive and adaptive design**: CSS media queries, mobile-first design, fluid layouts, breakpoints, flexbox, grid, viewport units, device testing.
- **Accessibility (a11y) best practices**: semantic HTML, ARIA roles/attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast, focus management, testing with aXe/VoiceOver.
- **Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility**: browser testing, polyfills, vendor prefixes, feature detection, progressive enhancement.
- **Building and maintaining design systems**: tokens, component libraries, documentation, versioning, design handoff, Figma integration.

## 5. Testing & Debugging
- **Unit, integration, and E2E testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Mocha, test structure, mocking, coverage, CI integration.
- **Test-driven development (TDD)**: writing tests before code, red-green-refactor cycle, benefits and tradeoffs.
- **Debugging tools and techniques**: Chrome DevTools (breakpoints, network, performance, memory), React DevTools, Redux DevTools, logging, error boundaries, source maps.

## 6. Modern Frontend Tooling
- **Webpack, Vite, and build optimization**: entry/output, loaders, plugins, code splitting, tree shaking, caching, environment variables, custom configurations, migration between tools.
- **Linting and formatting**: ESLint rules, Prettier integration, custom configs, pre-commit hooks (husky, lint-staged), fixing and enforcing code style.
- **CI/CD pipelines for frontend**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, automated testing, linting, building, deployment, environment variables, secrets management, rollback strategies.
- **Docker for frontend development**: writing Dockerfiles, multi-stage builds, local development with Docker, deploying containers, best practices for image size and security.

## 7. Backend Integration & API Design
- **RESTful API consumption and design**: HTTP methods, status codes, REST principles, API versioning, pagination, filtering, error handling, OpenAPI/Swagger.
- **Authentication and authorization**: OAuth2, JWT, session vs token, refresh tokens, secure storage, role-based access control, integrating with backend auth flows.
- **Error handling and data validation**: try/catch, error boundaries, user feedback, zod/yup for schema validation, handling API errors gracefully.
- **Working with Axios and async data flows**: interceptors, cancellation, retries, global error handling, request/response transformation.

## 8. Database & Data Modeling
- **SQL basics and query optimization**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs, indexes, normalization, query profiling, N+1 problem.
- **Data modeling for frontend consumption**: shaping API responses, DTOs, mapping backend data to UI, caching strategies, optimistic updates.

## 9. Security Best Practices
- **Web security principles**: XSS, CSRF, CORS, clickjacking, content security policy, HTTPS, secure cookies, input sanitization, OWASP Top 10.
- **Secure authentication flows**: login, registration, password reset, multi-factor authentication, secure token storage, session management.
- **Secure data handling in frontend**: avoiding sensitive data exposure, encrypting data in transit, secure local storage, handling secrets.

## 10. Collaboration & Leadership
- **Code review best practices**: constructive feedback, code quality, consistency, knowledge sharing, review tools (GitHub/GitLab), handling conflicts.
- **Technical documentation**: writing clear READMEs, API docs, architecture diagrams, inline comments, documenting decisions and tradeoffs.
- **Mentoring and knowledge sharing**: onboarding, pair programming, brown bag sessions, code walkthroughs, fostering team growth.
- **Agile methodologies and stakeholder communication**: Scrum/Kanban, sprint planning, retrospectives, user stories, communicating with PMs/designers, managing expectations.

## 11. Open Source & Community
- **Contributing to open source**: finding projects, submitting PRs, code of conduct, issue triage, writing good issues/PRs, maintaining a project.
- **Staying up-to-date with frontend trends**: following blogs, newsletters, conferences, Twitter, experimenting with new tools, continuous learning.
